    <p id="about"><!--- About --->
    <h2> It is essential for society to recognize the signs of child abuse and take action to prevent it. </h2>
    <p> It encompasses a range of abusive behaviors, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, as well as neglect. Children who experience abuse may suffer from a range of negative impacts, including trauma, mental health issues, and even physical harm or death.<br>  By speaking out against abuse, supporting organizations that work to protect children, and advocating for stronger laws and policies, we can help create a safer, healthier world for all children.<br> Remember, every child deserves to be loved, cherished, and protected.Child abuse is not just physical violence directed at a child. It is any form of maltreatment by an adult, which is violent or threatening for the child. This includes neglect.
When child abuse occurs in the home and the abuser is, for example, the child’s parent or care   giver, this is a form of domestic violence .But children are sometimes abused by other adults on whom they are dependent, such as day nursery workers, teachers and sports coaches.
Sometimes abuse is intentional, but not always. If parents or caregivers are no longer able to cope with caring for the child, this can result in dysfunctional behavior and abuse.

  <img src="img/abuse 2.jpg" />
<p>Some examples include slapping, pinching, choking, kicking, shoving, or inappropriately using drugs or physical restraints.<br>It has been estimated that roughly two-thirds of those harming a vulnerable adult are family members, most often the victim’s adult child or spouse. <br> Research has shown that in most instances the abuser is financially dependent on the vulnerable adult’s resources and have problems related to alcohol and drugs.

      <h4>Add some charts + captions that illustrate my topic and why it is a problem </h4>

    <ul>
        <li> Nearly 3 in 4 children - or 300 million children - aged 2–4 years regularly suffer physical punishment and/or psychological violence at the hands of parents and caregivers

Ongoing care of children and families can reduce the risk of maltreatment reoccurring and can minimize its consequences.</li>
        <li> One in 5 women and 1 in 13 men report having been sexually abused as a child aged 0-17 years.</li>
        <li> 120 million girls and young women under 20 years of age have suffered some form of forced sexual contact.</li>
        <li> Consequences of child maltreatment include impaired lifelong physical and mental health, and the social and occupational outcomes can ultimately slow a country's economic and social development.</li>

  <p id="impact">  <!--- Impact --->
    <h2>Impact!</h2>
<p>Child maltreatment is often hidden. Only a fraction of child victims of maltreatment ever gets support from health professionals.
A child who is abused is more likely to abuse others as an adult so that violence is passed down from one generation to the next. It is therefore critical to break this cycle of violence, and in so doing create positive multi-generational impacts.
Preventing child maltreatment before it starts is possible and requires a multisectoral approach.
Effective prevention approaches include supporting parents and teaching positive parenting skills, and enhancing laws to prohibit violent punishment. </p>
